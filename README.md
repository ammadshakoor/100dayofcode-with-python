# 100dayofcode-with-python
What's this course about and how is it different? 100 days of code is not just about the commitment. The true power and effectiveness is in having a guide and pursuing the "right-sized" projects. That’s why we have 33 deeply practical projects. Each paired with 20-40 minute lessons at the beginning of the project.  Just a small sampling of the projects you’ll work on include:  Understanding basic Python data structures Searching large text corpuses with regular expressions Consume HTTP services including the Twitter and GitHub APIs among others Visual data with graphs using plotly Convert your Python CLI (command line interface) app to a GUI application Program against Excel in Python to automate your spreadsheet data Build a text-based game and learn object-oriented programming Automate multi-step web processes using selenium Test your code with pytest and unit testing Create a basic web app with Flask Create a JSON-based online game service using Flask too And 22 more projects!
